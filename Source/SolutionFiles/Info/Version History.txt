	- Changed Stuff:	  
		- Edges and Vertices in a Graph are now stored in a Dictionary, in order to speed up lookups.
		- Changed Edges and Vertices properties on Graph<T> to return an ICollection object, replacing the Enumerator.
		- Changed IncidentEdges and EmanatingEdges on Vertex<T> to return an IList<Vertex<T>> in the form of a 
		  ReadOnlyCollection<Vertex<T>>.
		- Removed IncidentEdgesCount property on Vertex<T> - count can be obtained by using the IncidentEdges property.
		- Namespace changes for most of the data structures to avoid having them all bundled into one namespace.
		- Matrix moved to a 1-dimensional array implementation.
		- Couple of things fixed for compiling on Mono.
		- Added STRICT_VALIDATION compilation flag - not used at the moment, but I'm sure we'll find places.
		- Removed some of the index checks where the underlying data structure would perform the same check.
		- Fixed leaky abstraction in Matrix.
		- Added Serializability (and unit tests) on all data structures except ReadOnlyPropertyCollection.
		- Added SuppressMessage to (and fixed some) FxCop code violations.  Code Analysis can now be performed
		  without being scared of the nasty backlog of messages.
		- Update unit tests for more coverage.
		- Code cleanup :		
			- Fix spelling errors.
			- Remove redundant code.
			- Changed GetEnumerator() and MoveNext() calls to foreach loops where applicable.
			- Deleted the EqualityFindingVisitor since it was unused.		
		- Added NAnt build file that supports targets for both Mono 2.0 and .NET 2.0.	
		- NGenerics now compiles and unit tests succeed on Mono.  Differences between the Mono and NGenerics 
		  implementation is explained in the "ReadMe.txt" file.
		- Documentation
		- ReadOnlyPropertyList makes a copy of the IList<T> that is passed in on construction
		- HeapType would be moved from NGenerics.Enumerations to NGenerics 
		- PriorityQueueType would be moved from NGenerics.Enumerations to NGenerics.DataStructures.Queues
		- Values in PriorityQueueType and HeapType renamed to Minimum and Maximum
		- Change the namespace of internal enumerations.
		- Add DictionaryBase<TKey, TValue>. base class for VisitableHashtable
		- Added ISearchTree interface for RedBlackTree, BinarySearchTree, and SplayTree.
		- RedBlackTree's Minimum and Maximum properties now return a KeyValuePair instead of just the key in order to conform to the ISearchTree interface.
		- Create a params version of HashList.Add
		- Added Setter for property Data on GeneralTree.
		- Added DepthFirstTraversal to BinarySearchTreeBase - which will in turn add it to BinarySearchTree, and SplayTree.
		- Renamed all instances of "Min" and "Max" to "Minimum" and "Maximum". For consistency. 
		- Default Priority can now be changed in Priority Queue via a property.
		- Performance improvements in ObjectMatrix and Matrix
		- The following now throw a KeyNotFoundException if the key supplied is not found
		  SkipList.Item, BinarySearchTree.Item, RedBlackTree.Item, SplayTree.Item
		- Provide xml documentation for all exceptions.
		- Fixed a nasty bug in ObjectMatrix.GetColumn
		- Added Capacity property for PascalSet, and changed IsFull to actually return whether the set is full or not.
		- Removed EdgeCount and VertexCount properties from Graph.  These values can be accessed through the Edge and Vertex collections respectively.
		- Made IsWeaklyConnected() and IsStronglyConnected() methods instead of properties,
		  according to the Microsoft Design Guidelines (properties should not take a long time to run).
		- Fixed bug in SkipList where items on level 0 might not be removed under certain conditions.
		- Priority Queue is now FIFO instead of LIFO
		- Algorithms.Math and Algorithms.Graph changed to Algorithms.MathAlgorithms and Algorithms.GraphAlgorithms to avoid class name clashes.
		
	
	
1.2
---
	- Added Stuff:
		- ObjectMatrix
		- HashList
		- RedBlackTree
		- Prim's Minimal Spanning Tree Algorithm
		- ReadOnlyPropertyList
		
	- Changed Stuff :
		- Graph's AddVertex(T item) and AddEdge(Vertex<T> v1, Vertex<T> v2) now return the newly created vertex and
		  edge, respectively.			
		- Extracted Interfaces IMathematicalMatrix and IMatrix for Matrix type structures
		- Added ToKeyValuePair() Method on Association class.
		- Converted the BinarySearchTree<T> to BinarySearchTree<TKey, TValue> :  It now implements
		  the IVisitableDictionary<TKey, TValue> interface. 
		- VisitableList<T> and GeneralTree<T> now implements ISortable<T> and ISortable<GeneralTree<T>> respectively.
		- Methods added to the ISorter<T> and ISortable<T> interfaces to allow sorting with a Comparison<T> delegate.		
		- InterchangeRows, InterchangeColumns, GetRow, GetColumn, AddColumn, AddRow  added on IMatrix, Matrix and ObjectMatrix		
		- Added Parent property to GeneralTree<T> so bottom-up paths can be found.
		- Added Ancestors property to GeneralTree<T> to find any ancestors of the current node up in the tree.
	  
1.1
---
	- In an effort to take this project one step further, DataStructures.NET has received a bit of a face-lift, and is 
	  now dubbed NGenerics.  The project page can be found at http://www.codeplex.com/NGenerics. The latest source can
	  be found on the project page, but it will be periodically updated at Code Project.
	  
	  As such, major changes have been made :
		- The default namespace has been changed to NGenerics.
		- The strong name key for signing the assembly has been changed and is no longer distributed with the library.
		  This means that if you want to compile NGenerics from source, you need to provide your own key 
		  (or turn off signing for the assembly).
		  
	  Hopefully this will be the last major change - things should settle down now...
	  
	- Added Stuff :
		- DataStructures :
			- BinarySearchTree
		- Algorithms :
			- Euclid's Algorithm
			
	- Changed Stuff :
		- Added FindNode method to BinaryTree, GeneralTree and the ITree<T> interface.
		- Changed the IsSymmetric method of the Matrix to not make a transposition of the current matrix.
		- Extracted interface for Matrix : IMatrix
		- Added Methods/Properties to Matrix :
			- IsSquare
			- GetSubMatrix
			- Clone (Matrix now implements IClonable)

1.0 Release
-----------
	- Fixed :
		- Spelling mistake : BreathFirstSearch on GeneralTree and BinaryTree instead of BreadthFirstSearch.		
		
	- Added Stuff :
		- Sorters :
			- CombSorter
			- CocktailSorter
			- OddEvenTransportSorter 
			- ShakerSorter		
		- DataStructures :
			- SkipList
		- Algorithms :
			- Dijkstra's shortest path algorithm
	
	- Changed Stuff :
		- Changed PriorityQueue to take a PriorityQueueType parameter on 
		  construction, to specify whether it's a min priority queue or
	      a max priority queue.
	    - Split the IVisitable portion from the IVisitableCollection interface,
	      and introduced the IVisitableDictionary interface.	 
	    - Added a Weight field on the Vertex<T> class to accommodate vertex-weighted graphs.
	

1.0 Beta 2
----------
	- Graph data structure added.
	- Modified Singleton to have an internal setter for testing purposes,
	  as per M.Holmgren's  suggestion.
	- Heap now takes a HeapType parameter at construction to specify whether
	  it's a MinHeap or a MaxHeap.
	- Priority Queue is now implemented using a MaxHeap instead of a SortedList,
	  thanks to a suggestion by CastorTiu.
	- Removed the abstract VisitableCollection class.  All data structures now
	  implement the IVisitableCollection interface instead of inheriting from
	  the abstract VisitableCollection class.  While this does force the 
	  implementation  a couple of mundane methods multiple times, I feel that 
	  the interface is a much cleaner approach, since I can now "hide" methods 
	  through explicit implementation instead of just throwing a 
	  NotSupportedException.
	- SortedList now implements IList<T>.
	- Removed Visitor abstract class - all visitors now implement the IVisitor<T>
	  interface and the Accept method on the IVisitableCollection<T> interface
	  now takes a IVisitor<T> parameter.
	- Extracted interfaces for the following data structures :
		- IDeque for the Deque class.
		- IBag for the Bag class.
		- ISet for the PascalSet class.
		- IStack for the VisitableStack class.
		- ITree interface for the BinaryTree and GeneralTree classes.
		- IHeap interface for the Heap class.
		
	- Added Sorters :
		- ShellSorter
		- QuickSorter
		- BucketSorter
